# Apivore

Automatically tests your rails API against its OpenAPI (Swagger) description of end-points, models, and query parameters.

Currently supports and validates against OpenAPI 2.0, (see https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)

## Installation

To use Apivore, add the following to your Gemfile:

    gem 'apivore'

***WARNING:*** If apivore is listed in the Gemfile _above_ rspec then some issues, specifically `NameError: uninitialized constant RSpec::Mocks`, may arise when trying to run specs.

## Usage

Create a new request spec in spec/requests:
```ruby
# Rails users
require 'rails_helper'
# Everyone else
require 'spec_helper'

RSpec.describe 'the API', type: :apivore, order: :defined do
  subject { Apivore::SwaggerChecker.instance_for('/swagger.json') }

  context 'has valid paths' do
    # tests go here
  end

  context 'and' do
    it 'tests all documented routes' do
      expect(subject).to validate_all_paths
    end
  end
end
```
using the path to your application's Swagger 2.0 documentation. The convention is `/swagger.json`.

This will validate the json against the Swagger 2.0 schema and allow you to add tests for each documented endpoint combination of a path, method, and expected response.

If your Swagger documentation contains a schema for the response model, the generated tests will test whether the response conforms to that model.

For paths that take parameters, listed in the Swagger docs like `/deals/{id}.json`, values need to be passed to Apivore to substitute in to access the responses generated by your test data.

This is accomplished by passing the params into the validates function.
```ruby
context 'has valid paths' do
  let(:params) { { "id" => 1 } }
  specify do
    expect(subject).to validate(
      :get, '/deals/{id}.json', 200, params
    )
  end

  # or alternatively

  it { is_expected.to validate( :get, '/deals/{id}.json', 200, params ) }
end
```
A query string can be specified with the `_query_string` key as follows:

```ruby
expect(subject).to validate(
  :get '/deals', 200, {"_query_string" => "title=Hello%20World&edition=3"}
)
```
Parameters in the query string are not validated or processed by Apivore in any way.

Post parameters can be specified with the `_data` key as follows:

```ruby
expect(subject).to validate(
  :post '/deals', 200, {"_data" => {'title' => 'Hello World'} }
)
```

HTTP headers can be specified via the `_headers` key:

```ruby
expect(subject).to validate(
  :get '/deals', 200, {"_headers" => {'accept' => 'application/json'} }
)
```

Your Swagger.json can be validated against additional custom schemata, for example to enforce organisation API documentation standards, by using the following syntax:

```ruby
it 'additionally conforms to a custom schema' do
  expect(subject).to conform_to("<your custom schema>.json")
end
```
We have included an example [here] (data/custom_schemata/westfield_api_standards.json). The file path to this custom schema is stored in `Apivore::CustomSchemaValidator::WF_SCHEMA`, if you wish to use it.

Run the tests as part of your normal rspec test suite, e.g., `rake spec:requests`
